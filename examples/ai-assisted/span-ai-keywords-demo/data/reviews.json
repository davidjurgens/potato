{"id": "review_1", "text": "I absolutely love this wireless keyboard! The build quality is exceptional - solid aluminum frame with satisfying key travel. Battery life is incredible, lasting over 3 months on a single charge. The Bluetooth connectivity is rock solid with no lag or dropouts. Worth every penny of the $89 price tag. Highly recommend for anyone working from home!"}
{"id": "review_2", "text": "Terrible experience with this product. The quality is disappointing and the performance is sluggish. Customer service was unhelpful when I tried to get a refund. The packaging arrived damaged and the product had scratches on it. Do not buy this - save your money for something better."}
{"id": "review_3", "text": "This laptop is amazing for the price. The display is gorgeous with vibrant colors and sharp text. Performance handles my daily tasks smoothly - web browsing, office work, and even some light gaming. The keyboard feels great to type on. Only complaint is the webcam quality is mediocre, but that's minor compared to everything else."}
{"id": "review_4", "text": "Mixed feelings about this purchase. The design is beautiful and modern, but the functionality leaves something to be desired. Setup was confusing with poor documentation. Once working, performance is adequate but not exceptional. Good value if you can get it on sale, otherwise look elsewhere."}
{"id": "review_5", "text": "Outstanding headphones with premium sound quality! The noise cancellation is best-in-class, completely blocking out office noise. Comfortable enough for all-day wear with soft cushions. Battery lasts 30 hours which is excellent. The companion app has great customization options. My favorite tech purchase this year."}
