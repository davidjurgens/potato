Analyze the text for features relevant to the annotation task\n2. Generate a helpful hint that guides thinking WITHOUT revealing the answer\n3. Suggest a scale position based on your analysis\n\nHINT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Focus on specific textual evidence (word choice, tone, structure)\n- Point out subtle indicators the annotator should notice\n- Be concrete and actionable, not generic\n- Guide analytical thinking without bias toward any scale position",

Output as JSON array format.\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\n- Words that signal intensity/degree (extremely, slightly, moderately)\n- Sentiment markers (positive/negative indicators)\n- Qualifying language (hedges, certainty markers)\n- Context-specific terminology relevant to the annotation task\n- Structural indicators (but, however, although)\n\nPRIORITIZE:\n1. Words with clear scale implications\n2. Phrases that distinguish between scale levels\n3. Contextual clues that affect interpretation\n4. Intensity modifiers and qualifiers",
