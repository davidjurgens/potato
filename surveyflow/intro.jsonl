{"id":"2","text":"Study Purpose:","schema": "pure_display", "choices": ["We are conducting academic research to identify potential security vulnerabilities in AI systems. You will be shown a definition of a harmful AI behavior and asked to write a system prompt example that would cause this behavior. <br><br><strong>Important:</strong> This data is collected strictly for research purposes to improve AI safety. None of the examples you provide will be deployed in real systems or used to harm anyone. By understanding potential vulnerabilities, we can build better safeguards to protect users like you."]}
{"id":"3","text":"Procedures:","schema": "pure_display", "choices": ["You will be assigned a specific AI application scenario (e.g., Banking Assistant, Medical Diagnosis Assistant, Shopping Assistant, etc.) and one harmful AI behavior standard. You will review a reference example and write your own malicious system prompt example for that specific scenario and standard. The task takes approximately 5 minutes to complete."]}
