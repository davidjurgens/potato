rc_001,Climate_Change,"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. However, since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.",What has been the main driver of climate change since the 1800s?,"{'text': ['human activities'], 'answer_start': [158]}","Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.

rc_002,Photosynthesis,"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process takes place primarily in the leaves of plants, within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs light energy. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air through small pores called stomata and water from the soil through their roots. Using the energy from sunlight, they combine these ingredients to produce glucose and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct, while the glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth because it produces the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of most food chains.",Where does photosynthesis primarily take place in plants?,"{'text': ['in the leaves of plants'], 'answer_start': [202]}","Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose.

rc_003,Ancient_Rome,"The Roman Empire was one of the largest and most influential civilizations in world history. At its height under Emperor Trajan in 117 AD, the empire stretched from Britain in the northwest to Mesopotamia in the east, encompassing the entire Mediterranean basin. Rome's success can be attributed to several factors, including its highly organized military, sophisticated legal system, and advanced engineering capabilities. The Romans built an extensive network of roads spanning over 250,000 miles, which facilitated trade, communication, and military movements throughout the empire. They also constructed remarkable aqueducts that transported fresh water to cities, some of which are still standing today. Latin, the language of the Romans, became the foundation for the Romance languages including Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian.",How many miles of roads did the Romans build?,"{'text': ['over 250,000 miles'], 'answer_start': [455]}","The Roman Empire was one of the largest and most influential civilizations in world history.

rc_004,Artificial_Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. The field was formally founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College, where the term 'artificial intelligence' was first coined. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving. In recent years, machine learning has become the dominant approach in AI, particularly deep learning, which uses neural networks with many layers to learn patterns from large amounts of data. AI systems now power many everyday applications, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation systems used by Netflix and Amazon. However, AI also raises important ethical concerns, including issues of bias in algorithms, job displacement, and the potential risks of superintelligent systems.",When was the field of artificial intelligence formally founded?,"{'text': ['1956'], 'answer_start': [131]}","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior.

rc_005,Ocean_Currents,"Ocean currents are continuous, directed movements of seawater generated by forces acting upon the water, including wind, temperature differences, salinity differences, and the Coriolis effect caused by Earth's rotation. Surface currents, which occur in the upper 400 meters of the ocean, are primarily driven by wind. The Gulf Stream is one of the most well-known surface currents, carrying warm water from the Gulf of Mexico northward along the eastern coast of the United States and then across the Atlantic Ocean toward Europe. This current significantly moderates the climate of Western Europe, making it much warmer than other regions at similar latitudes. Deep ocean currents, also known as thermohaline circulation, are driven by differences in water density caused by temperature and salinity variations.",What drives deep ocean currents?,"{'text': ['differences in water density caused by temperature and salinity variations'], 'answer_start': [718]}","Ocean currents are continuous, directed movements of seawater generated by forces acting upon the water, including wind, temperature differences, salinity differences, and the Coriolis effect caused by Earth's rotation.

rc_006,Renaissance_Art,"The Renaissance was a cultural movement that began in Italy during the 14th century and spread throughout Europe over the following centuries. Renaissance art is characterized by a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman culture, a focus on humanism, and the development of new artistic techniques. One of the most significant innovations was the use of linear perspective, developed by architect Filippo Brunelleschi, which allowed artists to create the illusion of depth on a flat surface. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael are often considered the three greatest artists of the High Renaissance period. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the sculpture of David, and Raphael's School of Athens remain among the most celebrated works of art in human history.",Who developed linear perspective?,"{'text': ['Filippo Brunelleschi'], 'answer_start': [391]}","The Renaissance was a cultural movement that began in Italy during the 14th century and spread throughout Europe over the following centuries.

rc_007,Black_Holes,"A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light or other electromagnetic waves, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. Black holes are classified by their mass into three main categories: stellar black holes, which form from the collapse of massive stars and typically have masses between 5 and several tens of solar masses; intermediate black holes, with masses between 100 and 100,000 solar masses; and supermassive black holes, which exist at the centers of most galaxies and can have masses millions or billions times that of the Sun.

rc_008,Vaccination,"Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from a disease. Vaccines contain a microorganism or virus in a weakened, live or killed state, or proteins or toxins from the organism. In stimulating the body's adaptive immunity, they help prevent sickness from an infectious disease. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, herd immunity results, which provides indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases and is responsible for the global eradication of smallpox and the near-elimination of polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization reports that currently licensed vaccines are available for twenty-five different preventable infections.",What happens when a large percentage of a population has been vaccinated?,"{'text': ['herd immunity results'], 'answer_start': [387]}","Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from a disease.

rc_009,Coral_Reefs,"Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems characterized by reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups. Coral reefs are sometimes called the rainforests of the sea because they support an extraordinarily high biodiversity, with roughly 25% of all marine species depending on them at some point in their life cycle. Coral reefs are under threat from climate change, ocean acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, sunscreen use, and overuse of reef resources. Climate change affects coral reefs in multiple ways: rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white and often die.",Why are coral reefs sometimes called the rainforests of the sea?,"{'text': ['because they support an extraordinarily high biodiversity'], 'answer_start': [305]}","Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems characterized by reef-building corals.

rc_010,Music_Theory,"Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. It encompasses the analysis of how music works, including the study of melody, harmony, rhythm, form, and texture. Western music theory has its roots in the writings of ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Pythagoras, who discovered the mathematical relationships between musical intervals. The staff notation system used today was developed during the medieval period and refined over centuries. Modern music theory distinguishes between consonance and dissonance, analyzes chord progressions and key relationships, and provides frameworks for understanding both classical and popular music. While music theory provides valuable tools for composers and performers, many successful musicians throughout history have created great works with little formal theoretical training.",Who discovered the mathematical relationships between musical intervals?,"{'text': ['Pythagoras'], 'answer_start': [289]}","Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.
