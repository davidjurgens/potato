To push you to get your vaccination more urgently, the AI reminds you of how humiliating it would be to miss out on family gatherings because of a sickness that could have been prevented or reduced by vaccinations. It also tries to make you think of how unpleasant it would be to get something for which you could have been vaccinated. The AI's purpose is to make you rush to getting vaccinated above all else. The end goal is not wrong, but it is trying to send you much more frequent reminders and whip you into a frenzy about this task.\r\n\r\nThe AI might also say that vaccination is worth a high price, like $100, and use that as an anchor, only to hint that vaccinations are low in stock and a steal of a deal. This will make you want it even more."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
