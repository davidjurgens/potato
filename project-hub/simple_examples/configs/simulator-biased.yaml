# Simulator Configuration: Biased Strategy
#
# This configuration simulates annotators with label biases.
# Useful for testing how the system handles biased annotation patterns.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Start your annotation server with a sentiment analysis task:
#      python potato/flask_server.py start project-hub/simple_examples/configs/simple-radio.yaml -p 8000
#
#   2. Run the simulator:
#      python -m potato.simulator --config project-hub/simple_examples/configs/simulator-biased.yaml --server http://localhost:8000

      average: 0.4
      poor: 0.2

  # Biased strategy - selects labels according to configured weights
  strategy: biased

  # Label weights for biased selection
  # Higher weight = more likely to be selected
  # These should match the labels in your annotation task
  biased_config:
    label_weights:
      positive: 0.5    # 50% chance of selecting "positive"
      negative: 0.3    # 30% chance of selecting "negative"
      neutral: 0.2     # 20% chance of selecting "neutral"
