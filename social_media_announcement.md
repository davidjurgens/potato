**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

We just released Potato 2.0 - the biggest update yet to our open-source annotation platform for NLP research.

AI-powered assistance. Active learning. Audio & video support. And still free for researchers.

Here's what's new:

---

**Tweet 2 (AI Support)**

AI-Assisted Annotation

Potato 2.0 integrates with 7 LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and more) to help annotators work faster:

- Intelligent hints without revealing answers
- Keyword highlighting
- Label suggestions

Your annotators get guidance. You keep control.

---

**Tweet 3 (Active Learning)**

Active Learning Built In

Stop annotating randomly. Potato 2.0 uses ML to prioritize the most informative instances first.

Result: Same model quality with fewer annotations. Your annotation budget goes further.

**Tweet 4 (Multimodal)**

Beyond Text

New in 2.0:
- Audio annotation with waveform visualization
- Video annotation with frame-by-frame labeling
- Image region labeling

One platform for text, audio, video, and images.

---

**Tweet 5 (Quality Control)**

Quality Control That Actually Works

- Attention checks (catch distracted annotators)
- Gold standard tracking
- Inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Training phase with feedback

Know your data quality before it's too late.

---

**Tweet 6 (Why Potato)**

Why researchers choose Potato:

- Zero to annotating in minutes (just YAML config)
- Self-hosted = full data control
- No coding required
- Free for academic use

We've been used in 50+ research papers. Now it's even better.

**Announcing Potato 2.0: AI-Powered Annotation for NLP Research**

I'm excited to announce the release of Potato 2.0, a major update to our open-source text annotation platform used by NLP researchers worldwide.

After a year of development, this release brings capabilities that fundamentally change how research teams approach data annotation.

**What's New in 2.0**

**AI-Assisted Annotation**
Potato now integrates with 7 LLM providers—including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and local options like Ollama. Annotators get intelligent hints, keyword highlighting, and label suggestions without compromising annotation independence. The AI assists; annotators decide.

**Active Learning**
Stop annotating data randomly. Potato 2.0 uses machine learning to identify which instances will be most valuable to annotate next. In our testing, teams achieved equivalent model performance with 30-40% fewer annotations.

**Multimodal Support**
Beyond text, Potato 2.0 now supports:
- Audio annotation with interactive waveform visualization
- Video annotation with frame-by-frame labeling
- Image region labeling and classification

**Built-In Quality Control**
- Configurable attention checks
- Gold standard instance tracking
- Real-time inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha)
- Training phases with immediate feedback

**Enterprise-Ready**
MySQL backend support, comprehensive admin dashboards with suspicious activity detection, and session-based analytics for large-scale deployments.

**Why Potato?**

We built Potato because annotation tooling shouldn't be a barrier to good research. With Potato, you go from zero to annotating in minutes using simple YAML configuration—no web development required.

It's self-hosted, giving you complete control over sensitive data. And it's free for academic research.

Potato has been cited in 50+ research papers and used for annotation tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to dialogue systems to content moderation.

**Get Started**

```
pip install potato-annotation
```
